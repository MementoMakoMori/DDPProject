This little shiny app was created for Coursera & Johns Hopkins University's Developing Data Products course, with Profs. Brian Caffo, Roger Peng, and Jeff Leek. It is by no means a very advanced project, but that is by design - the first few iterations I tried used a massive, comprehensive dataset from the CDC on US heath, and cleaning/organizing/modeling the data took a terrible toll on my PC. Eventually (for my poor RAM and for the purpose of running well on a server), I dumbed down the project to a much simpler, easily-accesible dataset (UKLungDeaths, in the R System Library datasets package).

Changes I would like to make in the future:
*more recent dataset (so it can actually predict years that haven't happened yet!)
*cosmetic changes on text/graph spacing
*separate input buttons for the checkboxes and the dropdown list
